# ETL Fundamentals in Action: Practical Data Transformation with Python

This repository contains a Python script (`etl_practice.py`) designed to practice and demonstrate the fundamental concepts of an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process.

## Purpose for Recruiters

This script highlights my **learning process and my practical understanding of ETL concepts**. It indicates that I can not only write code but also **dissect and apply ETL principles** in a controlled environment, which is ideal for prototyping or as a learning tool. It shows my practical approach to data manipulation.

**Demonstrated Skills:**
* **Concept Comprehension:** Ability to implement theoretical ETL principles.
* **Data Analysis & Manipulation:** Practical experience in common transformations (cleaning, normalization, new column calculation).
* **Problem-Solving:** Focus on solving specific data problems through transformations.
* **Good Coding Practices:** Attention to detail in code organization and commenting.
* **Prototyping:** Ability to build functional models of data processes.
* **Key Library Usage:** Reinforces knowledge of `pandas` and other data processing libraries.

## Description

The `etl_practice.py` file is a practical example illustrating the stages of an ETL flow. Its purpose is educational and can serve as a basis for understanding how to:
1.  **Extract Data:** [Describe here the origin of the practice data, e.g., local CSV files, simulated data. Based on the code, it extracts car data from CSV, JSON, and XML files.]
2.  **Transform Data:** [Detail the transformations applied in this example, e.g., basic cleaning, filtering, simple aggregation. The code snippet shows rounding prices and converting data types.]
3.  **Load Data:** [Explain where the transformed data is loaded in this example, e.g., printing to console, saving to a new file. The code shows saving to a CSV file.]

This script is ideal for those learning about ETL and wishing to see a simple, functional example.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need Python (preferably Python 3.x) and the following libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
